        <h1>WHAT IS THE <i>UNIVERSE</i>?</h1>
        The Universe is all of space and time and their contents, 
        including planets, stars, and all other forms of matter and energy.
         While the size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible 
         to measure the observable universe.

        <h1>SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun 
        and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. 
        Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight 
        are the planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, 
        such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. 
        Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger 
        than the smallest planet, Mercury.
